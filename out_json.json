Please download the POSTIDENT app to your smartphone for the identification process.<br /><br />6. App protection Setup and consent to the privacy policy and terms of use<br />Please select an app protection. You can choose between fingerprint (TouchID) and facial recognition (FaceID). If an option is grayed out or not clickable, then it means that your device does not support this option and therefore cannot be selected. As soon as you have agreed to the privacy policy and the terms of use for the ePA, you can use the \"AOK Mein Leben\" app.<br /><br />7. The security of your file usage<br />In order to create an individual security key (code), a random value must be generated. Two options are offered for this purpose:<br />1. Movement of the smartphone or<br />2. Generation of sounds (e.g. by speech)<br />This random value is the basis for the key generation of your ePA.<br />Only with this key is it possible to decrypt the data on your mobile device. We recommend that you store the security key securely outside of your mobile device, as you will need it if you want to change the device or reinstall the app.<br /><br />8. Set up access to the electronic patient record (ePA)<br />You have two options for EHR registration:<br />1. Option: Login via the alternative insured identity (al.vi) if you do not have your electronic health card (eGK) and associated PIN at hand or do not have a PIN for your eGK. The alternative insured identity (al.vi) is linked to your user name and password (1st factor) and your device stored under step 4 (2nd factor). With it, you can log in to the app right away. You will receive a link by e-mail. As soon as you have confirmed this, go back to the app and click on \"Link confirmed\".<br />2. Option: Login with your eGK and PIN<br />To log in via the new NFC-enabled eGK, you need the corresponding PIN. If you have not yet received a PIN from your AOK, you can apply for one there. You will also need your username and password, which you used under point 3, as well as an NFC-enabled smartphone. To register, please place your smartphone above your eGK and then enter the 6-digit CAN (CardAccessNumber) of your eGK. These can be found at the top right of the front. Then please enter the PIN of your eGK that you received from your AOK."
